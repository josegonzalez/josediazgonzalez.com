<h1>No longer interested in new positions, freelance or otherwise.</h1>

<div style="display: none">
<h1>Available for the following work:</h1>

<ul>
	<li>Single-use CakePHP plugins concerning API integration, Admin scaffolding, Data Export, etc.</li>
	<li>WordPress plugin creation, ie. widget shortcode creation, custom page types, theme customization</li>
	<li>Infrastructure re-organization</li>
	<li>Custom automation tooling, eg. Server/Application deployment, data-ingestion</li>
	<li>Small admin utilities for data-handling</li>
</ul>

<p>Interested? Here is how it would work:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Send me an email at <a href="mailto:support@savant.be">support@savant.be</a> describing the type of work you want done and deadline</li>
	<li>I will respond back with further clarification and a very speculative quote. We'll go back and forth until we have a featureset in stone.</li>
	<li>I submit a document containing a contract with a featureset of what we'll be working off of. You are free to look it over and accept/reject the contract, and amend the featureset as necessary.</li>
	<li>If all goes well, you pay me half of what I estimate will be the total price. I bill by the hour, and if my estimate changes - either up or down - I will notify you. I start after first payment, as does my time estimate. Hourly billing is done through <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/">Freshbooks</a>, and payment depends upon our contract.</li>
	<li>You pay a further 25% at the halfway mark of the project. If you are unsatisfied at this point, I take the money you have already paid me and that's the end of business.</li>
	<li>You pay a final payment, and then I deliver code. If setup was included in the pricing, then setup is completed AFTER the final payment, not before.</li>
</ul>

<p>Still interested? Send an email to <a href="mailto:support@savant.be">support@savant.be</a> and we'll go from there.</p>

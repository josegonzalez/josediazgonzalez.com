This is an extremely short post where I'll ask that you all give back (not just monetarily) but with your time. Here are some projects that will need feedback before 3.0 goes general availability:

- [Retooling Validation](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/pull/5296)
- [Bake Improvements](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/5319)
- [Table-less FormModel classes](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/5251)
- [*Maybe* supporting users without ext-intl](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/5251)
- [Migrations project needs some work](https://github.com/cakephp/migrations/pull/34)

Some repos that need some love:

- [Datasources needs an update](https://github.com/cakephp/datasources)
- [Croogo CMS doesn't yet boot](https://github.com/croogo/croogo)
- [Break the Upgrade plugin!](https://github.com/cakephp/upgrade)
- [Doc work for 3.x](https://github.com/cakephp/docs/tree/3.0)
- [Filtering 3.x packages on the plugins site](https://github.com/cakephp/cakepackages)

CakePHP is a community project. If any of the above aren't things you're interested - but you'd love to give back - feel free to give feedback on existing features, write blog posts, and release updates of existing open source projects.

Until tomorrow!

## Summary

I'm an Infrastructure Engineer based in New York, New York with an [extremely active github account](https://github.com/josegonzalez/) and an interest in Application Deployment and Server Monitoring. My background is originally as a software developer, something which I continue to do in my spare time through open source. I've been doing this since around 2008 and sometimes I blog [on this website](/).
